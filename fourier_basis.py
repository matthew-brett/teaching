# ## The Fourier basis
#
# [Fourier without the ei](https://matthew-brett.github.io/teaching/fourier_no_ei.html) shows that we can write the discrete Fourier transform
# DFT as vector dot products.  In [Rewriting the DFT with vectors](https://matthew-brett.github.io/teaching/fourier_no_ei.html#rewriting-dft-with-vectors) we found
# that:
#
# $$
# X_k = \vec{x} \cdot \vec{c^k} - i \vec{x} \cdot \vec{s^k}
# $$
#
# where:
#
# $$
# \vec{r^k} = [ k 2 \pi \frac{0}{N}, k 2 \pi \frac{1}{N},
# k 2 \pi \frac{N-1}{N}] \\
# \vec{c^k} \triangleq \left[ \cos(r^k_0), \cos(r^k_1), \ldots
# \cos(r^k_{N-1} \right] \\
# \vec{s^k} \triangleq \left[ \sin(r^k_0), \sin(r^k_1), \ldots
# \sin(r^k_{N-1} \right]
# $$
#
# $\vec{c_k}, \vec{s_k}$ are *Fourier basis vectors*.
#
# We can compile all these vectors into matrices to form *Fourier basis
# matrices*.
#
# ### Rewriting the DFT with cosine and sine basis matrices
#
# Instead of writing the formulae for the individual elements $X_k$ and
# $x_n$, we can use matrices to express our formulae in terms of the
# vectors $\vec{X}, \vec{x}$.
#
# $\newcommand{C}{\mathbf{C}} \newcommand{S}{\mathbf{S}}$ Define a
# matrix $\C$ that has rows
# $[\vec{c_0}, \vec{c_1}, ..., \vec{c_{N-1}}]$:
#
# $$
# \C \triangleq
#  \begin{bmatrix}
#     c_{0,0}, c_{0, 1}, ..., c_{0, N-1} \\
#     c_{1,0}, c_{1, 1}, ..., c_{1, N-1} \\
#     ... \\
#     c_{N-1,0}, c_{N-1, 1}, ..., c_{N-1, N-1} \\
#  \end{bmatrix}
# $$
#
# Call $\C$ the *cosine basis matrix*.
#
# Define a matrix $\S$ that has rows
# $[\vec{s_0}, \vec{s_1}, ..., \vec{s_{N-1}}]$:
#
# $$
# \S \triangleq
#  \begin{bmatrix}
#     s_{0,0}, s_{0, 1}, ..., s_{0, N-1} \\
#     s_{1,0}, s_{1, 1}, ..., s_{1, N-1} \\
#     ... \\
#     s_{N-1,0}, s_{N-1, 1}, ..., s_{N-1, N-1} \\
#  \end{bmatrix}
# $$
#
# Call $\S$ the *sine basis matrix*.
#
# Now we can rewrite the forward and inverse DFT as matrix products:
#
# $$
# \vec{X} = \C \cdot \vec{x} - i \S \cdot \vec{x} \\
# \vec{x} = \frac{1}{N} \C \cdot \vec{X} + i \frac{1}{N} \S \cdot \vec{X}
# $$

#
# # Some properties of the cosine and sine basis matrices
#
# First we note that $\C$ and $\S$ are always real matrices,
# regardless of the input $\vec{x}$ or $\vec{X}$.
#
# Let’s show $\C$ and $\S$ as grayscale images.
#
# First we build $\C$ and $\S$ for our case with $N=32$:

C = np.zeros((N, N))
S = np.zeros((N, N))
ns = np.arange(N)
one_cycle = 2 * np.pi * ns / N
for k in range(N):
    t_k = k * one_cycle
    C[k, :] = np.cos(t_k)
    S[k, :] = np.sin(t_k)

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 5))
dftp.show_array(axes[0], dftp.scale_array(C))
axes[0].set_title("$\mathbf{C}$")
dftp.show_array(axes[1], dftp.scale_array(S))
axes[1].set_title("$\mathbf{S}$")

# ## Mirror symmetry
#
# From the images we see that the bottom half of $\C$ looks like a
# mirror image of the top half of $\C$. The bottom half of
# $\S$ looks like a sign flipped (black $\Leftrightarrow$
# white) mirror image of the top half of $\S$. In fact this is
# correct:
#
# $$
# C_{p,:} = C_{N-p,:} \; \mathrm{for} \; p > 0 \\
# S_{p,:} = -S_{N-p,:} \; \mathrm{for} \; p > 0
# $$
#
# Why is this? Let’s look at lines from the center of $\C$. Here we
# are plotting the continuous cosine function with dotted lines, with
# filled circles to represent the discrete samples we took to fill the row
# of $\C$:

center_rows = [N / 2. - 1, N / 2., N / 2. + 1]
fig = dftp.plot_cs_rows('C', N, center_rows)
fig.suptitle('Rows $N / 2 - 1$ through $N / 2 + 1$ of $\mathbf{C}$',
             fontsize=20)

# The first plot in this grid is for row $k = N / 2 - 1$. This row
# starts sampling just before the peak and trough of the cosine. In the
# center is row $k = N / 2$ of $\C$. This is sampling the
# cosine wave exactly at the peak and trough. When we get to next row, at
# $k = N / 2 + 1$, we start sampling after the peak and trough of
# the cosine, and these samples are identical to the samples just before
# the peak and trough, at row $k = N / 2 - 1$. Row $k = N / 2$
# is sampling at the Nyquist sampling frequency, and row
# $k = N / 2 + 1$ is sampling at a frequency lower than Nyquist and
# therefore it is being *aliased* to the same apparent frequency as row
# $k = N / 2 - 1$.
#
# This might be more obvious plotting rows 1 and N-1 of $\C$:

fig = dftp.plot_cs_rows('C', N, [1, N-1])
fig.suptitle('Rows $1$ and $N - 1$ of $\mathbf{C}$',
             fontsize=20)

# Of course we get the same kind of effect for $\S$:

fig = dftp.plot_cs_rows('S', N, center_rows)
fig.suptitle('Rows $N / 2 - 1$ through $N / 2 + 1$ of $\mathbf{S}$',
             fontsize=20)

fig = dftp.plot_cs_rows('S', N, [1, N-1])
fig.suptitle('Rows $1$ and $N - 1$ of $\mathbf{S}$',
             fontsize=20)

# Notice that for $\S$, the sine waves after $k = N / 2$ are
# sign-flipped relative to their matching rows before $k = N / 2$.
# Thus row $k = N / 2 + 1$ will be aliased to the same frequency as
# for row $k = N / 2 - 1$, but with a negative sign.
#
# It is this sign-flip that leads to the concept of *negative frequency*
# in the DFT, and to the property of *conjugate symmetry* from the DFT on
# a vector of real numbers. We will hear more about these later.
#
# # Matrix symmetry
#
# The next thing we notice about $\C$ and $\S$ is that they
# are transpose *symmetric* matrices:
#
# $$
# \C = \C^T \\
# \S = \S^T \\
# $$

assert np.allclose(C, C.T)
assert np.allclose(S, S.T)

# Why is this? Consider the first *column* of $\C$. This is given by
# $\cos(k 2 \pi 0 / N) = \cos(0)$, and thus, like the first *row* of
# $\C$, is always = 1.
#
# Now consider the second row of $\C$. This is a cosine sampled at
# horizontal axis values:
#
# $$
# \vec{t_1} \triangleq \left[ 2 \pi \frac{n}{N} \;\mathrm{for}\; n \in
# 0,1,\ldots,N-1 \right]
# $$
#
# Call $t_{k, n}$ the value of $\vec{t_k}$ at index $n$.
# Now consider the second *column* of $\C$. This is a cosine sampled
# at horizontal axis values for $n = 1$:
#
# $$
# t_{0,1} = (0) 2 \pi \frac{1}{N} \\
# t_{1,1} = (1) 2 \pi \frac{1}{N} \\
# ... \\
# t_{N-1,1} = (N-1) 2 \pi \frac{1}{N} \\
# $$
#
# In general, because the sequence $k 0,1,,N-1 $ is equal to the sequence
# $n \in 0,1,\ldots,N-1$, this means that the column sampling
# positions for row $n \in t_{0, n}, t_{1, n}, ... , t_{N-1, n}$ are
# equal to the row sampling positions for corresponding ($k = n$)
# row $k \in t_{k, 0}, t_{k, 1}, ... , t_{k, N-1}$. Write column
# $z$ of $\C$ as $C_{:,z}$; column $z$ of
# $\S$ is $S_{:, z}$. Therefore
# $C_{z, :} = C_{:, z}, S_{z, :} = S_{:, z}$.
#
# # Row dot products and lengths
#
# It is useful to look at the dot products of the rows of $\C$ and
# $\S$. The dot product of each row with itself gives the squared
# *length* of the vector in that row.
#
# The vector length of a vector $\vec{v}$ with $N$ elements is
# written as $\| \vec{v} \|$, and defined as:
#
# $$
# \| \vec{v} \| \triangleq \sqrt{\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} v_n^2}
# = \sqrt{ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{v} }
# $$
#
# The dot products of different rows of $\C$ and $\S$ give an
# index of the strength of the relationship between the rows. We can look
# at the dot products of all the rows of $\C$ with all other rows
# with the matrix multiplication $\C^T \C$:

dftp.show_array(plt.gca(), dftp.scale_array(C.T.dot(C)))
plt.title("$\mathbf{C^TC}$")

# The image shows us that the dot product between the rows of $\C$
# is 0 everywhere except:
#
# * the dot products of the rows with themselves (the squared vector
#   lengths);
#
# * the dot products of the mirror image vectors such as
#   $\vec{c_1}$ and $\vec{c_{N-1}}$. Because
#   $\vec{c_n} = \vec{c_{N-n}}$, these dot products are the same as
#   the $\| \vec{c_n} \|^2$.
#
# The squared row lengths are:

np.diag(C.T.dot(C))

# Notice that the rows $\vec{c_0}$ and $\vec{c_{N / 2}}$ have
# squared length $N$, and the other rows have squared length
# $N / 2$.
#
# We can do the same for $\S$:

dftp.show_array(plt.gca(), dftp.scale_array(S.T.dot(S)))
plt.title("$\mathbf{S^TS}$")

# Remember that $\vec{s_0}$ and $\vec{s_{n/2}}$ are all 0
# vectors. The dot product of these rows with any other row, including
# themselves, is 0. All other entries in this $\S^T \S$ matrix are
# zero except:
#
# * the dot products of rows with themselves (other than
#   $\vec{s_0}$ and $\vec{s_{n/2}}$);
#
# * the dot products of the flipped mirror image vectors such as
#   $\vec{s_1}$ and $\vec{s_{N-1}}$. Because
#   $\vec{s_n} = -\vec{s_{N-n}}$, these dot products are the same
#   as $-\| \vec{s_n} \|^2$.
#
# The squared row lengths are:

np.diag(S.T.dot(S))

# The rows $\vec{s_0}$ and $\vec{s_{N / 2}}$ have squared
# length $0$, and the other rows have squared length $N / 2$.
#
# Finally, let’s look at the relationship between the rows of $\C$
# and the rows of $\S$:

np.allclose(C.T.dot(S), 0)

# The rows of $\C$ and $\S$ are completely orthogonal.
#
# In fact these relationships hold for $\C$ and $\S$ for any
# $N$.
#
# ## Proof for $\C, \S$ dot products
#
# We can show these relationships with some more or less basic
# trigonometry.
#
# Let’s start by looking at the dot product of two rows from $\C$.
# We will take rows $\vec{c_p} =\C_{p,:}$ and
# $\vec{c_q} = \C_{q,:}$. As we remember, these vectors are:
#
# $$
# \vec{c_p} = \left[ \cos(p n \frac{2 \pi}{N}) \;\mathrm{for}\;
# n \in 0,1,\ldots,N-1 \right] \\
# \vec{c_q} = \left[ \cos(q n \frac{2 \pi}{N}) \;\mathrm{for}\;
# n \in 0,1,\ldots,N-1 \right]
# $$
#
# So:
#
# $$
# \vec{c_p} \cdot \vec{c_q} = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \cos(p n \frac{2 \pi}{N}) \cos(q
# n \frac{2 \pi}{N})
# $$
#
# Our trigonometry tells us that:
#
# $$
# \cos \alpha \cos \beta = \frac{1}{2} [ \cos(\alpha + \beta) - \cos(\alpha -
# \beta) ]
# $$
#
# We can rewrite the dot product as the addition of two sums of cosines:
#
# $$
# \vec{c_p} \cdot \vec{c_q} =
# \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \cos((p + q) n \frac{2 \pi}{N}) +
# \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \cos((p - q) n \frac{2 \pi}{N})
# $$
#
# Now we can use the formulae for sums of [arithmetic progressions of
# cosines and sines](sum_of_cosines.html) to solve these equations.
# Here are the formulae:
#
# $$
# R \triangleq \frac{\sin(N \frac{1}{2}d)}{\sin(\frac{1}{2} d)} \\
# \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \cos(a + nd) =
# \begin{cases}
# N \cos a & \text{if } \sin(\frac{1}{2}d) = 0 \\
# R \cos ( a + (N - 1) \frac{1}{2} d) & \text{otherwise}
# \end{cases}
# \\
# \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \sin(a + nd) =
# \begin{cases}
# N \sin a & \text{if } \sin(\frac{1}{2}d) = 0 \\
# R \sin ( a + (N - 1) \frac{1}{2} d) & \text{otherwise}
# \end{cases}
# $$
#
# For our $\C, \S$ row dot product sums, starting angle $a$ is
# always 0, and the $d$ value in the formulae are always integer
# multiples of $\frac{2 \pi}{N}$. For example,
# $d = (p \pm q) \frac{2 \pi}{N}$ in the equations above. For our
# case, we can write $d = g \frac{2 \pi}{N}$ where $g$ is an
# integer.
#
# $$
# R = \frac{
# \sin( g N \frac{1}{2} \frac{2 \pi}{N} )
# }
# {
# \sin( g \frac{1}{2} \frac{2 \pi}{N} )
# } \\
# = \frac{ \sin( g \pi ) } { \sin( \frac{g}{N} \pi ) }
# $$
#
# Because $g$ is an integer, the numerator of $R$ will always
# be 0, so the resulting sum is zero unless the denominator of $R$
# is zero. The denominator is zero only if $g$ is a multiple of N,
# including 0. When the denominator is zero, the sum will be equal to
# $N \cos(a) = N \cos(0) = N$ for a cosine series or
# $N \sin(a) = N \sin(0) = 0$ for a sine series.
#
# Now we can calculate our dot product:
#
# $$
# \vec{c_p} \cdot \vec{c_q} =
# \begin{cases}
# \frac{1}{2} N + \frac{1}{2} N = N & \text{if } p = q, p \in 0, N/2 \\
# \frac{1}{2} N & \text{if } p = q, p \notin 0, N/2 \\
# \frac{1}{2} N & \text{if } p + q = N, p \ne N/2 \\
# 0 & \text{otherwise}
# \end{cases}
# $$
#
# We can apply the same kind of logic to the rows of $\S$:
#
# $$
# \sin \alpha \sin \beta = \frac{1}{2} [ \cos(\alpha - \beta) - \cos(\alpha +
# \beta) ]
# $$
#
# So:
#
# $$
# \vec{s_p} \cdot \vec{s_q} =
# \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \cos((p - q) n \frac{2 \pi}{N}) -
# \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \cos((p + q) n \frac{2 \pi}{N})
# $$
#
# This gives:
#
# $$
# \vec{s_p} \cdot \vec{s_q} =
# \begin{cases}
# 0 & \text{if } p = q, p \in 0, N/2 \\
# \frac{1}{2} N & \text{if } p = q, p \notin 0, N/2 \\
# -\frac{1}{2} N & \text{if } p + q = N, p \ne N/2 \\
# 0 & \text{otherwise}
# \end{cases}
# $$
