    "\n",
    "I based the page on my understanding of the 1992 paper by Keith Worsley (see\n",
    "refs below). For me, this paper is the most comprehensible paper on random\n",
    "fields in neuroimaging. Please refer to this paper and the Worsley 1996 paper\n",
    "for more detail.\n",

    "### The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Most statistics packages for functional imaging data create statistical\n",
    "parametric maps. These maps have a value for a certain statistic at each\n",
    "voxel in the brain, which is the result of the statistical test done on\n",
    "the scan data for that voxel, across scans. $t$ values and\n",
    "$F$ values are the most common.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, I’ll assume that we have $Z$ values\n",
    "instead of $t$ or $F$ values. $Z$ values are values\n",
    "from the standard normal distribution. The same sort of arguments apply\n",
    "to $t$ and $F$ values, just with slightly different\n",
    "formulae.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis for a particular statistical comparison probably\n",
    "will be that there is no change anywhere in the brain. For example, in a\n",
    "comparison of activation against rest, the null hypothesis would be that\n",
    "there are no differences between the scans in the activation condition,\n",
    "and the scans in the rest condition. This null hypothesis implies that\n",
    "the whole brain volume full of statistic values for the comparison will\n",
    "be similar to a equivalent set of values from a random distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The multiple comparison problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Given we have a brain full of $Z$ values, how do we decide whether\n",
    "some of the $Z$ values are larger (more positive) than we would\n",
    "expect in a similar volume of random numbers? So, in a typical brain\n",
    "volume, we have, say, 200000 voxels and therefore 200000 $Z$\n",
    "scores. Because we have so many $Z$ scores, even if the null\n",
    "hypothesis is true, we can be confident that some of these $Z$\n",
    "scores will appear to be significant at standard statistical thresholds\n",
    "for the the individual $Z$ scores. For example, $p$ value\n",
    "thresholds such as $p<0.05 $ or $p<0.01 $ correspond to $Z = 1.64 $ and\n",
    "$Z = 2.33 $ respectively."

    "# Why not a Bonferroni correction?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of false positives with multiple statistical tests is an old\n",

    "Bonferroni correction. For the Bonferroni correction, you set your p\n",

    "$alpha$ / (number of tests), where $alpha$ is the false\n",
    "positive rate you are prepared to accept. $alpha$ is often 0.05,\n",
    "or one false positive in 20 repeats of your experiment. Thus, for a\n",
    "statistical map with 200000 voxels, the Bonferroni corrected p value\n",
    "would be 0.05 / 200000 = [equivalent Z] 5.03. We could then threshold\n",
    "our Z map to show us only Z scores higher than 5.03, and be confident\n",
    "that all the remaining Z scores are unlikely to have occurred by chance.\n",
    "For some functional imaging data this is a perfectly reasonable\n",
    "approach, but in most cases the Bonferroni threshold will be\n",
    "considerably too conservative. This is because, for most stastistic\n",
    "maps, the Z scores at each voxel are highly correlated with their\n",
    "neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Spatial correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional imaging data usually have some spatial correlation. By this,\n",
    "we mean that data in one voxel are correlated with the data from the\n",

    "\n",
    "* With low resolution imaging such as PET, data from an individual\n",
    "  voxel will contain some signal from the tissue around that voxel;\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unmodeled brain activation signal, which is very common, will tend to\n",
    "  cover several voxels and induce correlations between them;\n",
    "\n",
    "* Resampling of the images during preprocessing causes some smoothing\n",
    "  across voxels;\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most neuromaging statistical analyses work on smoothed images, and\n",
    "  this creates strong spatial correlation. Smoothing is often used to\n",
    "  improve signal to noise according to the matched filter theorem (the\n",
    "  signal we are looking for is almost invariably spread across several\n",
    "  voxels).\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this spatial correlation is a problem for the Bonferroni\n",
    "correction is that the Bonferroni correction assumes that you have\n",
    "performed some number of *independent* tests. If the voxels are\n",
    "spatially correlated, then the $Z$ scores at each voxel are not\n",
    "independent. This will make the correction too conservative.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Spatial correlation and independent observations\n",
